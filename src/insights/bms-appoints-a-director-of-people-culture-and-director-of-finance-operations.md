This historic mission agency was going through a period of considerable transition, including changes to the senior leadership team. The People & Culture role was new, and the Finance & Operations was reshaped with a broader remit. We spent some weeks working with the senior team to define the shape of these roles.

The People & Culture role was especially interesting, requiring someone with considerable organisational development experience to help lead BMS towards a radically polycentric vision.

Candidates were successfully appointed to both roles at Easter 2022.
