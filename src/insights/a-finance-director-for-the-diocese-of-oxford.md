In 2020 Carnelian was privileged to run a search for a new Finance Director for the Diocese of Oxford.

The Diocese of Oxford is a charity with £26m turnover, £130m in investments and 100 staff. It also supports 283 church schools. By several measures, it is the second largest diocese in the Church of England. The complexity of dioceses, especially such a large one, means that this is one of the most demanding FD roles in the charity sector.

We worked closely with he Diocesan Secretary to recruit a highly capable finance leader, who would form an important member of the senior leadership team and have the breadth of experience for this complex charity.
