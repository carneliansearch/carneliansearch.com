Innovista is a unique and rapidly growing Christian charity providing leadership training to young people across Europe and central Asia. As demand for their services increased, Innovista approached Carnelian to lead a search for a newly-created role within the structure of the ministry - Chief Operating Officer.

The purpose of the role was to build out capacity and provide structure to an organisation that had developed organically after spinning out from a larger parent ministry a number of years before. It would require an experienced and versatile operational leader with an appetite for growth and a missional heart. With oversight of several teams across the UK and beyond, the COO would also need to be a gifted relationship builder, supporting the International Director in his overall leadership of the ministry.

Carnelian presented a longlist of 8 candidates several of whom brought international experience. After several rounds of internal interviews, a successful appointment was made, to be announced in due course.
