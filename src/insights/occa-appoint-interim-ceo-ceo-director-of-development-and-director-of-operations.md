During a period of significant change at the charity, the trustees at OCCA approached Carnelian to lead several searches with the purpose of recruiting a new senior team. This was a longer-term partnership with the ministry over the course of nearly two years, requiring both a careful understanding of where the organisation had been and the trustees' hopes for the future.

Â In each case the research demanded both persistence and creativity in a competitive market, often journeying with candidates over a series of conversations. It was proof however, that working hard to uncover missionally - aligned candidates can lead to strong appointments, even in challenging contexts. James Gardner, Chair of the board reflected on the CEO search as follows:

"We hold Carnelian in the highest regard. Consummate professionals, friendly and approachable, they made a real effort to understand our culture and mission. It was evident that they had also taken great care to build strong relationships with the candidates they recommended to us. Very happy with the outcome, and we are already working with them on the next assignment."
