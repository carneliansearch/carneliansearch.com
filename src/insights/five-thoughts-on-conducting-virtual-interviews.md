Since the coronavirus lockdown we have had to conduct all interviews virtually. Although we still believe that the face-to-face interview is the best way to assess candidates, at Carnelian Search we have found that there are ways to mitigate the downsides.

**1. Interview for longer.** Before the lockdown we normally conducted 60-minute face-to-face interviews with candidates. During lockdown this has often increased, giving us more time to probe into areas we are nervous about.

**2. Interview in pairs.** Before lockdown we often interviewed in pairs. Now we always do. One person listens to the content, the other pays attention to all the other non-verbal forms of communication that are harder to pick up when the person isn’t sitting in front of you (tone of voice, sense of humour, body language if using a video call, etc.)

**3. Use informal referencing.** We have often felt that this is an underused tool. During lockdown it is more important than ever. Post-interview formal referencing is frequently a box-ticking exercise. Informal referencing happens before the interview and involves seeking off-the-record comments on the candidate from a trusted source. Often it’s informal referencing that gives the really valuable information.

**4. Audio vs video calls.** It is often assumed that videos calls must be better for interviewing. But audio calls have many advantages. With audio calls:

- You often listen more attentively to the person. There is greater sensitivity to tone and choice of words when they’re they only information presented.
- Strangely, there is greater intimacy. Therefore, trust often builds more quickly.
- You are not distracted by the picture of yourself in the corner of the screen.
- There is no off-centre eye contact that comes from the gap between screen and camera. In normal life, someone who will not meet your eye is considered untrustworthy or socially dysfunctional.
- Often we have two calls with a candidate so that we benefit from the advantages of each: the first an audio call, the second a video call.

**5. Use psychometric testing.** Personality styles and ways of working are harder to assess without meeting in person. Psychometric testing can often help make up for this.
