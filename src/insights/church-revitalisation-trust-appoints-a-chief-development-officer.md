During 2021, Carnelian Search were approached by the CEO of Mission Without Borders International, Stephen Young. This international development organisation, working primarily in Eastern Europe, needed a Chief Information Officer to oversee all things IT and digital. This is a senior role, reporting to the CEO, and sitting on the international leadership team.

We conducted a wide-reaching search and three strong candidates were shortlisted for interview with Mission Without Borders International. This was our first time recruiting an IT professional, and we therefore brought on a Search Advisor with an IT background to guide us in assessing the technical expertise of the candidates.

The successful candidate started in early 2022.
