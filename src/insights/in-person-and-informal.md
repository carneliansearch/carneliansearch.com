As the ‘return to the office’ debate rumbles on, most of our clients are navigating the double-edged sword that is remote working. It offers invaluable flexibility, particularly to those with caring responsibilities. But if the pandemic affirmed anything, it was that we are embodied people and so online is no substitute for in person.

This is not an argument in either direction on the ‘return to the office’ question, but an underlining of the importance of informal, in person connection in the way it relates to senior appointments.

We always advise organisations, even those who are completely remote with no office space, to meet face to face with the rest of the Board or Executive Team when making major recruitment decisions. We seek to host clients in our office for the shortlisting meeting, giving them in person time together away from their ordinary settings to take the longer, wider view of the organisation in their care.

Why? On such a decision, it is imperative that the Chair can accurately discern the feelings and insights of her or his Board Members. If they are separated by many miles and many screens, discussion will inevitably be less fluid, and it will be harder to perceive how each trustee feels. It is hard to have healthy disagreement and debate online. Such moments also rely on a Board having relational strength, which requires them to have spent in person and informal time together in the past. Boards who can laugh together are far more likely to understand one another emotionally, and this provides a strong basis for making thorough and unanimous decisions.

When it comes to interviewing the candidates, and for Chief Executive and Chair appointments in particular, we encourage Boards to have informal, in-person time together – a coffee or a walk for ‘fireside chat’.

Why? There is no better way of getting to know someone than spending time with them. You can ask any number of questions designed to test someone’s relational strengths, their EQ, their self-awareness, their character. These questions will begin to build a picture of the candidate’s person. But it’s when the pressure is taken off, as you stroll around the edge of a nearby park and talk about someone’s family or church or most recent holiday that you really see what makes someone tick.

Wherever it’s possible, we interview candidates in person for this same reason. We want to understand people, not just superficially, but to get to the heart of their stories so that we are able to advise them and our clients on the points of connection and disconnection between an individual, a role and an organisation.

In person and informal time together is at the heart of good relationships, and good relationships are at the heart of excellent appointments.
