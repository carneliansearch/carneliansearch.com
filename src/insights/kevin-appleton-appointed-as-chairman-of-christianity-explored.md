Carnelian Search was privileged to work with the Board of Christianity Explored to appoint a new Chair. Kevin will join as Chair Designate in autumn 2021.

Our experience is that charity Chair searches are often challenging. The fit with the existing organisation must be excellent. The incoming Chair needs to know she/he has the full support of the existing Board. The role unremunerated and the time commitment is significant.

We conducted a comprehensive search, giving us and the Board confidence that we had left no stone unturned. The longlist we presented to the board was short but high-calibre.

John Ibbett, Vice Chair, led the process from the Christianity Explored side. John said: “Allan and his team with their extensive experience helped us to finalise a clear brief for the role, executed the search with regular feedback and prayer and presented us with a list of excellent potential candidates. It is very unlikely that the candidate who we appointed, and whose profile suits us perfectly, would be with us without Carnelian’s specialist skills. We are delighted and could not recommend them more highly. Great value for money."

Kevin Appleton, the successful candidate said: “Christianity Explored has made a profound difference to the resources available for running scripturally faithful evangelism programmes.  I am excited to work with my fellow trustees, the executive team and our supporter base to wisely discern the best way of further increasing the impact we can make in spreading the message of the gospel, in the UK and beyond in the years to come.”

Kevin was previously CEO of Lavendon plc and then Divisional Chair of Travis Perkins Merchanting. He holds a number of board roles in commercial and not-for-profit organisations.
