On Monday 19th September, the nation paid its last respects to Queen Elizabeth II. In his sermon, the Archbishop of Canterbury observed that ‘People of loving service are rare in any walk of life. Leaders of loving service are still rarer.’ As a nation, we continue to grieve the life of a servant-leader, a monarch who used her life and authority to serve those around her. Here at Carnelian, it has struck us that her majesty’s life and the loss we feel at its end of it, is a testament to the power and strength of her leadership. Much of what made her such an excellent and remarkable monarch is peculiar to that role. But there are elements of her leadership which speak to those in authority across society and in different kinds of role. Here, we offer a few thoughts on what we have lost.

## Bestowing Dignity

The monarch is a position of singular power and privilege. But more remarkable than the Queen’s status was her use of it to bestow dignity on others. Those who knew or met her spoke of her great kindness and humility, as well as her sense of humour. The Queen used her position and authority to dignify others, condescending (in the true sense of the word), and uplifting. Whilst there is in one sense no comparison between her majesty and the Lord Jesus, her example speaks of his in Philippians, who did not use his divine status to serve himself, but instead ‘emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant’. As the Archbishop described, the Queen is a rare example of someone who used her power and status to serve her people, and her God. A lesson for all leaders.

## Change Management

It is hard to imagine a greater cultural change than that which has taken place during the reign of Elizabeth II. Arguably, no monarch has ever overseen so great a transformation in so many sectors. The monarchy, standing as the pillar on which the British constitution and much of its culture rests, could have been threatened by these changes, as well as by growing republican sentiment. Yet the Queen has presided over a growth in support for the monarchy. An ancient institution which many think of as outdated, has managed to adapt and remain current without losing its traditions and prestige. Of course, the Queen was not a CEO driving this culture change, but functioned in some ways as a Chair or Board of Trustees, overseeing others driving vast change whilst remaining committed to the principles and values of her country.

## Nurturing Relationships

Perhaps her greatest strength during such a period of change at home and across the globe was the Queen’s ability to maintain strong diplomatic ties through judiciously apolitical relationships with leaders around the world. This was particularly visible in the international outpouring of affection for the Queen in the days following her death. While tension has increased between the UK and France in recent years, Emmanuel Macron’s tribute to the Queen was one of the most poignant and eloquent to be heard. Likewise as Gideon Rachman [observes in the FT](https://www.ft.com/content/4f6aa7a9-aaca-4a3f-9c2d-6ae34cf85c96) on this very topic, Australian support for republicanism is currently at its lowest for over 40 years. The Queen’s wisdom in transcending political disputes played a crucial role in maintaining the UK’s international relationships, the value of which is still felt in countries around the world. There is a lesson here for leaders from different spheres in the benefits of humility and careful judgement exercised to preserve relationships with parties representing a range of interests.
