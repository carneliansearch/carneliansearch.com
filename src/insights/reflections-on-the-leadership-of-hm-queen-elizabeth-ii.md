On Monday 19th September, the nation paid its last respects to Queen Elizabeth II. In his sermon, the Archbishop of Canterbury observed that ‘People of loving service are rare in any walk of life. Leaders of loving service are still rarer.’ As a nation, we continue to grieve the life of a servant-leader, a monarch who used her life and authority to serve those around her. Here at Carnelian, it has struck us that her majesty’s life and the loss we feel at the end of it, is a testament to the power and strength of her leadership. Much of what made her such an excellent and remarkable monarch is peculiar to that role. But there are elements of her leadership which speak to those in authority across society and in different kinds of role. Here, we offer a few thoughts on what we have lost.

## Bestowing Dignity

The monarch is a position of singular power and privilege. But more remarkable than the Queen’s status was her use of it to bestow dignity on others. Those who knew or met her spoke of her great kindness and humility, as well as her humour. The Queen used her position and authority to dignify others, condescending (in the true sense of the word), and uplifting. Whilst there is in one sense no comparison between her majesty and the Lord Jesus, her example speaks of his in Philippians, who did not use his divine status to serve himself, but instead ‘emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant’. As the Archbishop described, the Queen is a rare example of someone who used her power and status to serve her people, and her God.

## Change Management

It is hard to imagine a greater cultural change than that which has taken place during the reign of Elizabeth II. Arguably, no monarch has ever overseen so great a transformation in so many sectors. The monarchy, standing as the pillar on which the British constitution and much of its culture rests, could have been threatened by these changes, as well as by growing republican sentiment. Yet the Queen has presided over a growth in support for the monarchy. An ancient institution which many think of as outdated, has managed to adapt and remain current without losing its traditions and prestige. Of course, the Queen was not the sole voice in steering the monarchy through this, but the achievement came with her at the helm – an adaptable, principled leader.

## Legacy Building

We have written before about the problems which arise when senior leaders are loath to give up their position to those coming up beneath them. The Queen did not, of course, face such an issue: her position was hers until she died. Yet it is difficult to imagine the Queen without her family leading alongside her – with (as he now is) King Charles, the newly created Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Princess Anne. All these faces and names are familiar to the nation, as they played their parts in royal leadership with authority for portions of the nation’s life delegated to them. This delegation has sometimes backfired, as the fallibility of her family has become apparent. Yet it has also allowed King Charles to build a role, a style, and a position of his own within the nation’s heart and mind – a difficult feat following the events of the last century. Any change in monarch must feel strange, and yet the warmth and readiness of the nation to embrace King Charles III speaks of the Queen Elizabeth’s deliberate enabling of the leadership of those around her.
