Hope into Action is a rapidly growing charity dedicated to working with the church to house the homeless.

When the founder, Ed Walker, announced his plans to move on, the board approached Carnelian Search to help with the appointment of a new CEO.

Finding a CEO to take over a founder-led organisation always has complexities, and inevitably presents a challenge for the board. We worked with the board to explore their aspirations for the organisation and sharpen the brief. Over a three month research period we considered 125 candidate ideas, which we refined to a longlist of eight.

The successful candidate was Jon Kuhrt, who is due to start the role in 2023.

Reflecting on the board’s experience of working with Carnelian Search, the Chair of Trustees said: 

“We have appreciated enormously the professionalism, support and wisdom of Carnelian as well as their clear spiritual values and understanding.  They gave us a wide pool of people to consider and were always available to respond to our queries.  They also made the job of the trustees less arduous as they did so much of the initial interviewing and matching of gifts and experience.”
