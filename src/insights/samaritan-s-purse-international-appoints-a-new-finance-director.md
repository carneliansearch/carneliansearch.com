Carnelian Search has been privileged to work with the Executive Director of Samaritan’s Purse International, Darren Tosh, to lead a search for a new Finance Director. Samaritan’s Purse is a well-regarded Christian international relief organisation. The requirements were narrow, so a careful and comprehensive search was conducted.  The successful candidate starts in November 2022. 

“Carnelian did an outstanding job of understanding us as an organisation, and our business needs. I remain truly impressed with how well they represented our ministry to candidates. It’s fair to say that Carnelian ministered to us through their approach and successful recruitment.” 

\- Darren Tosh, Executive Director, Samaritan’s Purse International
