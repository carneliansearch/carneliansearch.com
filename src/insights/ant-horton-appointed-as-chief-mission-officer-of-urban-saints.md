Carnelian was privileged to work with the Board of Urban Saints to lead a search for a Chief Mission Officer.

Urban Saint’s vision is to be an effective disciple-making movement; reaching young people in every community in the UK and Ireland. Founded in 1906, and originally called ‘Crusaders’, today it is a national youth discipleship charity.

Ant Horton was appointed as the successful candidate. Ant was previously Chief Executive of East to West. He started the role at Urban Saints in summer 2021.

Sharon Prior, Chair of the Board of Trustees says,

> “Ant will be a great addition to the staff team at Urban Saints, as he has a track record of strategically working with staff teams and volunteers alike to fulfil the mission of the organisations he has worked for. We are excited about all he can bring to Urban Saints from his vast experience and look forward to working with him.”

Of his appointment, Ant says, 

> “I’m hugely excited to be given the opportunity to join Urban Saints and to get to know the team and everyone in the movement across the UK and Ireland where values of Adventure, Discipleship and Justice are central to who we are and what we do.”
