The Church Revitalisation Trust (CRT) was born out of Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) with the ambitious vision to reverse the decline of the Church of England by resourcing church plants across the country and seeing social transformation brought about by the church. They aim to plant 100 churches by 2028, and are already well on their way to this target.

During lockdown, a daughter charity was founded alongside CRT: Love Your Neighbour (LYN). This began as an emergency foodbank at HTB in April 2020 but quickly spread through the HTB network of churches and beyond. A network of organisations, LYN delivers over 17 million meals, debt advice, employment support and wrap-around care to those most in need.

The CRT/LYN partnership sought a Chief Development Officer to help them grow with the aim of becoming one of the household names in the charity sector. They were looking for a proven strategic leader who combined a highly-relational approach to work with the ability to train up a team in fundraising, as well as the gravitas needed to relate to senior individuals. Candidates needed to be able to demonstrate a commitment to their causes, as well as the emotional intelligence needed to span two organisations and CEOs, and support them both in their growth journeys.

The search was enormously interesting. We considered over 120 potential candidates from a variety of sectors, and interviewed 8. From these, we selected 6 candidates. The successful candidate started with the CRT/LYN team in January 2022.
