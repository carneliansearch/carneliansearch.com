**You’ve sat on boards for many years. How have boards changed over that time?** 

I first joined a board in my early 30s. I think I was very lucky to sit on boards from a young age. It allowed me to get into the governance mindset early on. Yes, I have seen changes over the years, and it has been interesting to watch good governance come into boards, and continue to do so.

Fixed terms of office are now the norm. For the board, there is always a fine line between being a critical friend of the executive and being too closely involved. Terms of office are important in maintaining that line. Staying on a board too long can mean there is greater danger of being seen as part of the executive team.

Another difference is that board members are now more likely to understand their responsibilities towards fundraising, and to give money personally. That wasn’t the case so much when I first started. 

Subcommittees were comparatively rare in the past. I think that change is a good thing – it concentrates decision making on the people with expertise.

And, of course, there are more women on boards now.

**What have you learnt about leadership over the course of your career?** 

One thing I’ve learnt about is listening to people and empowering people. It’s so easy to just give solutions; it’s much better to ask: ‘What do you think you should do?’ When I first started in leadership, I know I was quite a micromanager. That’s something I’ve had to learn.

Another thing is to help the team be a team. That helps people enjoy coming into work. People shouldn’t be siloed. Away days, seeing each other in person, etc., are so important and help the team be more creative.

One of the things I’ve learnt about being a good board member is the importance of knowledge of ‘the product’. Whether it’s theatre, art exhibitions, local services, or whatever, you must know it.

**What impact have your board roles had on you personally?**

My time as a Chapter member at St Paul’s Cathedral and taking part in services, including being asked to write and lead intercessions, has been very formative in my spiritual journey, and my decision to become a Lay Reader.

I was also Chair of Trustees of a local counselling charity for several years. That enabled me to build more connections locally. I’m also on the board of a ballet school, which offers BA (Hons) degrees, in Professional Dance, which has given me a whole new area of insight. So, each board has played a big part in my personal journey.

**What have you learnt in the last year that has surprised you?**

As part of my training to be a Lay Reader, I’ve had the privilege to spend the time with people who have the most amazing faith and are happy to talk about it. In general, I’ve been quite private in my faith, but recently I’ve learnt to be more open and less introverted about it. I’ve learnt about the power of showing God in our relationships with others.

**What book do you have on your bedside table?**

*The School that Escaped The Nazis* by Deborah Cadbury. I’m reading that for my book club. It’s about an entire school that came to England from Germany. I’m also reading Andrew Cotter’s *Oliver Mabel and Me*.
