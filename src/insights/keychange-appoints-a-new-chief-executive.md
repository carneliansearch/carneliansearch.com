    Having appointed an interim leader, we engaged Carnelian to help us find a
    new permanent Chief Executive to steer Keychange through a challenging time
    in our sector and on towards a new future.


    Throughout the process, we were kept informed of progress and in due course were presented with a varied longlist including candidates with a breadth of strengths and experiences. After a competitive series of interviews, the trustees were united in our choice of a preferred candidate. Carnelian remained on hand to support us through final discussions and communication with candidates, in due course securing our new Chief Executive who is now several months into the role.


    Carnelian were sensitive in understanding what it means for Keychange to be a Christian charity, assessing with precision both the character and skill we required in potential candidates. We would confidently work with them again.”

In Spring 2022, Keychange approached Carnelian to support them in securing a new Chief Executive. Maddy Thomson, Chair of Trustees, described the process:

*“Having appointed an interim leader, we engaged Carnelian to help us find a new permanent Chief Executive to steer Keychange through a challenging time in our sector and on towards a new future.*

*Throughout the process, we were kept informed of progress and in due course were presented with a varied longlist including candidates with a breadth of strengths and experiences. After a competitive series of interviews, the trustees were united in our choice of a preferred candidate. Carnelian remained on hand to support us through final discussions and communication with candidates, in due course securing our new Chief Executive who is now several months into the role.*

*Carnelian were sensitive in understanding what it means for Keychange to be a Christian charity, assessing with precision both the character and skill we required in potential candidates. We would confidently work with them again.”*

The challenge in this search was uncovering candidates with the leadership ability to take on an organisation of this size, combined with the determination to provide new vision and drive growth in a highly regulated and challenging sector.

Benjamin Downing, formerly of Open Doors and Kids Alive International, took on the post of Chief Executive in December 2022.
