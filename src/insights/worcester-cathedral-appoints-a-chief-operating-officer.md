Chief Operating Officers are the most senior lay appointments in Anglican cathedrals. The role varies significantly from cathedral to cathedral, but is always complex, incorporating a vast array of responsibilities, from business and strategy, to finance and fabric. For the right candidates, the complexity is the appeal as the breadth of the role, plus the multi-dimensional nature of a cathedral (a place of historical, cultural, spiritual, commercial and national importance), makes this role forever stimulating and unique. Worcester Cathedral is rightly viewed as a centre of excellence amongst cathedrals – with high standards across all areas, a reputation testimony to the capability of, among others, the current Dean and the then-outgoing COO.

The cathedral sought a humble, resilient leader to take their operation to the next level and to continue to develop the legacy of the previous COO and the rebuilding of projects following the pandemic. The right candidate needed to have a real breadth of experience, understanding of the complexity of the Church of England and the life of a cathedral, and a Christian faith which would power their endless problem-solving.

We researched over 90 organisations, and considered over 120 candidates for this fascinating role – statistics which reflect the difficulty of finding such a multi-faceted leader. From these 120, we interviewed seven. From these seven, Matthew Hall was appointed. Matthew’s previous role was as Deputy Diocesan Secretary for the Diocese of Bristol.
