After working with the board over a number of years on governor recruitment, Carnelian were approached to find a successor to respected Chair, Professor Helen Langton.

This was a very challenging search. Chairs within the charity sector are often the hardest roles to fill because of the significant time commitment combined with the voluntary nature of the post. The Chair of Monkton was no exception to this rule - rather, the complexities of a large Christian boarding school required even greater levels of availability, experience and wisdom than the vast majority of Chair posts.

Over a period of a several months and through various avenues of research, Carnelian assembled a small but competitive list of candidates open to discussions about taking on the post. After in-depth conversations with Carnelian and rigorous internal interviews, Professor Ewan McKendrick, Professor of Law and former Registrar at the University of Oxford, was appointed to the post. He will start his first term as Chair in September 2022.
