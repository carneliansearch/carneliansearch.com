  quote: It’s rare to find a search company that takes the time to actually get to
    know you. Allan and the team at Carnelian were careful, they were
    considerate, they learnt about us, and showed us that we were working
    together to find Robin who accepted the role…

Charity A have a single goal: stop bad thing B from happening. They do this by intervention C and have seen some remarkable results. From the first time we came across them we were excited at the prospect of pushing this vital work forward in any way we could.

In 2019, Charity A needed a new chief executive to lead them forwards after the retirement of their long-serving founder. This is a critical role at what is a relatively small organisation and the appointment had to be right. Not only did the candidate need experience leading social impact work in field D, but they also had to grasp the unique way Charity A tackles this problem. And they had to share the Christian faith which is what drives the small and dedicated team. The precise cocktail of requirements made Carnelian Search tailor-made to come alongside Charity A to identify the perfect fit for the role.

> We realised straight away we did not have the resources in house to find our new chief executive after our founder had stood down. But we worried that a big, impersonal recruitment firm would never understand our own unique DNA as a Christian charity in this sector. So we were thrilled to be recommended Carnelian Search.

Our team swung into action, burying themselves in in-depth research and drawing on our years of expertise in the charity sector. Once we were sure we knew exactly what made Charity A tick, we began looking for possible candidates, whittling them down one by one through interviews. Throughout the search we made sure we kept in close contact with Charity A, sharing our progress and hearing their feedback, until we felt we had found the ideal match.

> We always felt like Allan and his team really understood us. We were never left in the dark throughout the process, but worked very closely together – leaning on Carnelian Search’s expertise and impressively thorough research.

Our search eventually led us to \[new hire’s name], who impressed us and Charity A with her experience and passion for tackling bad thing B.

> This might sound weird, but I actually really enjoyed being recruited by Carnelian Search. It was obvious how much time they had spent researching both the me and the role, and that made it easy to see both how I would fit in at Charity A and that I had the right blend of skills to take them forward. Agreeing to become their next chief executive has turned out to be the best decision I ever made.

> We couldn’t be happier with our new leadership under \[new hire’s name] and we would never have found her without Carnelian Search. Their team worked their socks off to uncover exactly the right person – and our charity will be the beneficiary of this for years to come.
