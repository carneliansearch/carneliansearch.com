Kay Carter has been appointed as UK National Director of Christianity Explored Ministries. Kay leaves her role as Vice Principle for Strategy and Communications at Tyndale House to take up this position in summer 2021.

Christianity Explored Ministries (CEM) exists to help people meet Jesus in the pages of Scripture so that they love, live and tell the Good News. The ministry produces a range of resources which introduce Jesus Christ to those unfamiliar with his message.

Late in 2020, the CEM board approached Carnelian to discuss the search for a UK National Director. This was a newly created role, reflecting the CEO’s increasing focus on the international expansion of the ministry. A versatile leader was required to oversee a product-focussed team and take responsibility for all aspects of the ministry in the UK.

Our research included scoping a range of likeminded ministries housing potential candidates with closely shared theological convictions and relevant complex skillsets. It was complimented by our usual emphasis on seeking recommendations from a range of trusted advisors. In addition to particular competencies, candidates needed to demonstrate a deep commitment to personal witness and evangelism. The Carnelian team’s support and understanding of the theological positioning of CEM helped us partner closely with the organisation and assess candidates well.

A small but strong field of candidates for the role emerged. Our flexible approach meant we were able to adapt the search timetable to include a worthwhile late entrant.
