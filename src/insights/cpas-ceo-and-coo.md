Carnelian Search has worked with CPAS on two occasions recently. In 2021, we worked with the CEO to appoint a new COO. Then in 2022 we worked with the board to appoint a new CEO.

This widely respected and influential Anglican evangelical mission agency required an excellent leader who would develop a vision for the next phase of CPAS’s journey.

The Chair of Trustees, Bishop Mark Tanner, says: “On behalf of the trustees of CPAS, I am delighted to announce the appointment of the Rev Jon Scamman as our new Chief Executive Officer. Jon has had a long association with CPAS; he is an Arrow Leadership Programme graduate, has been vicar of St Thomas’ Lancaster, a CPAS patronage church, for the last 12 years, and his children have attended various Venture holidays over the years.”
