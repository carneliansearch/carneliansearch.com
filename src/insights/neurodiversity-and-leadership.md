‘Neurodiversity’ is an umbrella term encompassing a range of conditions that mean individuals process information in a way significantly different from what is considered ‘typical’. One in seven people in the UK are neurodivergent, so it is vital for leaders to build inclusive workplaces which enable such team members to flourish.

For faith-based organisations, inclusion holds an especially important place. Every person is made in God’s image and reflects something of his glory. We must allow space for different ways of thinking to flourish if we want to fully experience the richness of the great body of people he is building. 

Although much has been done in recent years to combat stigmas and stereotypes, fear of judgement and lack of accommodation still holds individuals back, as is evidenced by employment gaps (1). [](#_ftn1)In this piece, we highlight a few qualities associated with neurodiversity and inclusive workplaces to encourage leaders to pursue practices which enable neurodiverse employees to bring their unique offering to the table.   

***Cognitive Diversity***

Studies link ADHD with creativity, autism with excellent analytical skills, and dyslexia with the ability to find patterns. Intense focus, innovation, and passion are all associated with neurodiversity and highly prized skills across sectors. Those with significantly different methods of processing information bring fresh ideas and an ability to question supposed received wisdom; skills increasingly important in the fast-moving contexts of the twenty-first century. In short, having a range of ways of thinking will only strengthen your organisation and make it more robust.

***Resilience***

The lived experience of neurodivergent people is also likely to have honed character traits of benefit in the workplace. Managing interactions in a world that is oriented around neurotypical thought often fosters a heightened level of self-reflection and self-awareness. Similarly, navigating barriers invisible to the rest of the population breeds resilience and persistence. These are core relational and leadership skills, often hard to come by. 

***Humble Leadership***

Leadership which truly values inclusion is often characterised by humility – a willingness to listen, learn and change. Such leaders may see unexpected blessings from their commitment to diversity. For example, the ‘Curb-Cut Effect’ is a term originally coined following the modification of pavements for wheelchair users. The benefits of having dips in pavements flowed outwards, benefitting those with suitcases and parents with prams, as well as those who it was originally intended to benefit.  Holding space in your leadership to listen, nurture, and be curious towards different modes of thinking and maintaining a willingness to change will benefit every member of your organisation, often in ways you cannot foresee.
